                                            <blogtitle>How it started</blogtitle>
                                            <br>
                                            <p>
                                                Scuba diving started with the fear of missing out on exciting robotics lab field experiments, the inner voice screaming ‚Äúif others can do it, so can you!‚Äù, 
                                                and a hasty 2 hour WhatsApp exchange with a local diving school in Hong Kong.
                                                 On top of all that, I thought, why not try something new?</p>
                                            <blogtitle>Lesson #1: If you made a commitment, be true to your word.</blogtitle>
                                            <p>My three days of in-person diving sessions were all accompanied by rainstorms and even occasional lightning. </p>
                                            <p>As rain poured relentlessly from the sky, obscuring visibility and creating an atmosphere of uncertainty, 
                                                I found myself facing the daunting task of completing 24 diving tasks. With each task, my wetsuit became heavier and more saturated, 
                                                clinging to my body like a second skin. Yet, amidst the discomfort and the temptation to give in to the elements, I forged ahead, 
                                                determined to honor the commitment I had made to myself, my coach, my research advisor and colleagues. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>My coach later told me that most people who gave up scuba diving gave up on just the 3rd task - underwater mask retrieval.
                                            </p>
                                            <p style="text-align: center; color:darkcyan;font-size: 12px ;font-family:'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">True character is revealed not in the absence of obstacles, but in the unwavering dedication to overcome them. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>In those moments, I discovered the power of resilience and the satisfaction that comes from pushing beyond self-imposed limitations. 
                                                Scuba diving taught me that when we make a commitment, it is our duty to honor it, regardless of the obstacles that may come our way. 
                                                It is in keeping our promises, even when the path seems arduous and uncomfortable, that we build <i>trust</i>, <i>strength</i>, and ultimately, a sense of <i>self-worth</i>. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                            <s>I had 24 chances to bail out. </s> I had 24 milestones to prove my resilience.
                                            </p>
                                            <blogtitle>Lesson #2: Do not let your mind overpower you with overthinking. Enjoy the present and make the best of it.</blogtitle>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Complain less. Instead of thinking ‚ÄúNo, but‚Ä¶‚Äù, think ‚ÄúYes, and‚Ä¶‚Äù and find the best solution.</li>
                                                <li>Trust the process.</li>
                                                <li>More importantly, trust yourself.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>Scuba diving has bestowed upon me the art of quieting the overthinking mind and embracing the present moment. 
                                                I realized the futility of excessive mental chatter and the beauty of simply being. 
                                                Instead of succumbing to the grip of doubt or dwelling on what could go wrong, I discovered the power of a positive mindset. 
                                                Complaining less became a guiding principle, as I shifted from "No, but..." to "Yes, and..."; seeking solutions and opportunities rather than dwelling on limitations. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Moreover, my diving coach's wisdom echoed within me: "99.9% of the problems that happen underwater can be solved underwater." This reminder instilled a deep sense of trust, 
                                                both in the training I had received and in my own capabilities.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <strong>Adaptable, resilient, pioneering.</strong> The words I‚Äôd use to describe myself when answering college supplemental questions have finally come to fruition.
                                            </p>
                                            <blogtitle>Lesson #3: Look around. Life is beautiful. </blogtitle>
                                            <p>Scuba diving unveiled to me the awe-inspiring beauty of the ocean and its magnificent marine inhabitants. 
                                                As I descended into the depths, I was greeted by a kaleidoscope of marine life. 
                                                The tranquil rhythm of the underwater world captivated my senses, leaving me humbled and mesmerized. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Witnessing the graceful dance of coral reefs, adorned with intricate patterns and teeming with life, I realized the profound interconnectedness of every living creature in our ecosystem. 
                                                The armored sea urchins showed me that even the toughest creatures can have the softest interiors.
                                                The rusty hollow boat wreck, now covered in a profusion of sea snails, signaled the slow and silent passing of time.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>In my environmental studies class, my professor once asked us, ‚Äúhow much damage are we creating by kicking up some sand on the beach?‚Äù</p>
                                            <p>‚ÄúNot much,‚Äù a classmate I recalled said. ‚ÄúAfter all it‚Äôs just a small kick and the sand comes back down.‚Äù</p>
                                            <p>‚ÄúIs it measurable? How do you define ‚Äòsmall‚Äô?‚Äù the professor smiled gently. And the class was silent.</p>
                                            <p>‚ÄúTo you, a microscopic organism is just what‚Äôs defined in a textbook. But by kicking up the sand, 
                                                you are disrupting some kind of delicate equilibrium that‚Äôs represented in that microscopic world. From the perspective of the microscopic organism, that change is profound.‚Äù </p>
                                            <p>Scuba diving taught me to appreciate the fragility of our oceans and the urgency of preserving their delicate balance. 
                                                It instilled in me a sense of responsibility to protect these magnificent habitats and the countless species that call them home. 
                                                For we are entering their home and trying to study them, almost like how Truman‚Äôs World was reenacted.

                                            <p>
                                                My new found love for the ocean - love beyond a few black words on paper - has brought to me a stronger sense of duty to protect it, 
                                                and how to create positive impacts as a responsible, aspiring marine roboticist. 
                                                It was more than just the fear of missing out on having fun with my research colleagues. 
                                                It was for our shared love for the ocean and how to preserve its beauty.

                                            <p>Finally, I took a moment of joy feeling so grateful and happy for this experience.</p>
