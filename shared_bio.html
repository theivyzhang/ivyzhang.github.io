    <p>I am a senior undergraduate student at <a href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a> majoring in
      Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently conduct research at the Dartmouth <a href="https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/jacobsonlab/"> AI and Mental Health: Innovation in Technology-Guided Healthcare (AIM HIGH) Laboratory </a>,
      advised by Professor <a href="https://www.nicholasjacobson.com/">Nicholas Jacobson</a>,
      where I focus on developing machine learning models and techniques for mental health applications. 
      My recent work, in collaboration with Professor <a href="https://souyoungjin.github.io/">SouYoung Jin</a>, explores wearable actigraphy data and foundation models for behavioral insights.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also conducted research at the <a href="https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/home/"> Dartmouth Reality and Robotics Lab (RLab) </a> advised by Professor <a
      href="https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/albertoq/">Alberto Quattrini Li</a>, where I contributed to advancing autonomous navigation for marine robotics and collaborating on a project for a multi-modal perception dataset for autonomous surface vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Dartmouth, my research has been generously supported by multiple fundings, including 
      the <a href="https://neukom.dartmouth.edu/funding/students/neukom-scholars-program">Dartmouth Neukom Institute for Computational Science</a> and 
      the <a href="https://students.dartmouth.edu/ugar/research/programs/presidential-scholars/program-information">James O. Freedman Presidential Scholarship</a>.
      I have also completed a rigorous curriculum, including seven graduate-level CS courses, and earned five academic citations for excellence in CS coursework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of academics, I enjoy mountain biking, skiing, and scuba diving, and I have been playing the cello for 13 years.
